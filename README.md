An application to slim down Excel or CSV files to just the desired subset of columns

When the user uploads an Excel or CSV file, the application loads it into a dataframe and provides a picklist of columns.
The user selects the desired columns via the picklist and has the option of exporting the slimmed down dataframe to Excel or CSV.
The application also allows the user to export the list of selected columns for future use: the user can upload that list to the application
in lieu of using the picklist function.
